# sideways-gif
Ever wonder what a video looks like when seen sideways through time?
I did, and I couldn't find any program to find out, so I made one!
Using the image2GIF framework, sideways-gif processes a GIF, treating the video as a 3d rectangular prism and exchanging the time dimension with a space dimension.
One way to think of it is to imagine that the GIF is a flipbook, the pages are all glued together before the book is sliced apart from a different direction.
The results are strange semi-abstract forms that are sometimes quite beautiful!
