# sideways-gif
Sideways-gif rearranges a GIF, treating the video as a 3d rectangular prism and exchanging the time dimension with a space dimension.
Imagine that the GIF is a flipbook, the pages are all glued together before the book is sliced apart from a different direction.
The results are molten forms in the boundary between recognizability and abstraction.
