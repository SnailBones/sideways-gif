Sideways-gif rearranges a GIF, treating the video as a 3d rectangular prism and exchanging the time dimension with a space dimension.
Imagine that the GIF is a flipbook, the pages are all glued together before the book is sliced apart from a different direction, creating strange molten forms. Run the example GIF back through the code to see the original.

Dependencies: Numpy, Pillow, imagio
Run with `python shifter.py your/gif/file.gif [-v (for vertical switching)]`
